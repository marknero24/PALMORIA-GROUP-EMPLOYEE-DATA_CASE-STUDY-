## 📑 Project Overview

Palmoria Group, a leading manufacturing company in Nigeria, came under scrutiny following a media exposé titled *“Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”*, raising concerns about gender inequality and wage disparity in its workforce across three key regions — Abuja, Kaduna, and Lagos.

- Assess gender distribution across the company
- Analyze performance ratings by gender
- Evaluate salary structures for potential pay gaps
- Confirm compliance with a new $90,000 minimum salary regulation
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve gender and pay equity within the organization

## 📑 Conclusion

- Several departments and the Kaduna region display gender and salary imbalances.
- Minimum salary compliance is insufficient, risking regulatory penalties.
- Some male-dominated salary bands indicate opportunities for internal equity review.
