# PALMORIA-GROUP-EMPLOYEE-DATA_CASE-STUDY-
Gender Equality and pay gap Analysis 


##  Project Overview

Palmoria Group, a leading manufacturing company in Nigeria, came under scrutiny following a media exposé titled *“Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”*, raising concerns about gender inequality and wage disparity in its workforce across three key regions — Abuja, Kaduna, and Lagos.

The management mandated a comprehensive HR analytics project to:
- Assess gender distribution across the company
- Analyze performance ratings by gender
- Evaluate salary structures for potential pay gaps
- Confirm compliance with a new $90,000 minimum salary regulation
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve gender and pay equity within the organization

---

- Gender Distribution: Overall, by Region, by Department  
- Performance Ratings Distribution by Gender  
- Salary Structures and Gender Pay Gaps  
- Minimum Salary Compliance  
- Pay Distribution by $10,000 Salary Bands

##  Tools Used

- **Microsoft Power BI** (for dashboarding and visual analytics)
- **Microsoft Excel** (for initial data cleaning and extraction)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control and documentation)

|:----------------|:------------------|
| $30,000 - $40,000 | 50                 |
| $40,000 - $50,000 | 80                 |
| $50,000 - $60,000 | 120                |
| $60,000 - $70,000 | 200                |

| $80,000 - $90,000 | 90                 |
| $90,000 - $100,000| 80                 |
| $100,000+         | 124                |



---

##  Conclusion

- Several departments and the Kaduna region display gender and salary imbalances.
- Minimum salary compliance is insufficient, risking regulatory penalties.
- Some male-dominated salary bands indicate opportunities for internal equity review.

---

##  Recommendations

1. **Set gender equity targets** for Legal, Support, and Product Management.
2. **Adjust salaries** to ensure compliance with the $90,000 regulation.
3. Conduct a **comprehensive pay equity audit** (see `/reports/Salary_Equity_Audit.xlsx`).
4. Implement **bias-free performance review protocols**.
5. Roll out **leadership mentoring and promotion pipelines** for underrepresented genders.
